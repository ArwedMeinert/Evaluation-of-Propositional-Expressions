# Evaluation-of-Propositional-Expressions
---

In the course "MatLab II" we were given a practical project at the end of the semester. I got to programm a MatLab/Octave programm to evaluate logical expressions in the for of 
~AvB<->B#A
The programm can evaluate an expression in the form given above and generate the truth-table. The programm can also evaluate propositional expressions given in  a "real language" (german) such as: 
Arbeit impliziert Geld oder Essen
To evaluate the expression above, it first converts it to the short form
A->GvE
and after that generates the truth Table.
